# keras_visualizer
A front-end keras visualizer

## Description
This is a front-end, keras model visualizer. Existing visualizers only work within Tensorflow or other back-end wrappers, however, in an effort
to eliminate or reduce vendor-lock scenarios, we though that it would be a good idea to create a front-end visualizer. There is already a front-end
solution available [here](https://github.com/lordmahyar/keras-visualizer) but there is limited functionality. We aim to expand on this work by adding
more layers and output formats but most importantly, adding simulation type functionality to the visualizer to allow designers to see how their data 
is transformed though the neural network.
